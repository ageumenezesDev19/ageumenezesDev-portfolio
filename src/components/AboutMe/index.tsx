      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>Front-end Web Developer, I studied for 6 to 7 months at <a href="https://www.betrybe.com/" target="_blank"><b >Trybe</b></a>, a Computer Science school.
          With the knowledge acquired there, I was able to start my career as a Software Engineer. I develop this portfolio as well as other projects, and I am continuing my studies at <a href="https://www.rocketseat.com.br" target="_blank"><b>Rocketseat</b></a>, <a href="https://go.hotmart.com/O61634593X" target="_blank"><b>Cataline</b></a> and others.</p><br/>

      <p>Brazilian, I'm 21 years old and I live in the state of Cear√°. I like to watch science fiction,
        animation and adventure movies. I Also like to appreciate nature, enjoy international and electronic music.</p><br/>

      <p>I chose to be a Software Engineer because I identified with it and want to be able to get a good job opportunity. By the way, Software Engineering is one of the great pillars of the world and something very interesting.
        That's why I dedicate myself developing my hard skills, soft skills and projects as in the examples below.</p>
