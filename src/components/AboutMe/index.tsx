        Hailing from the state of Cear√°, Brazil, I'm a 21-year-old tech enthusiast. When I'm not
        immersed in code, you'll find me captivated by physics, science fiction, animation, and
        adventure movies. I have a deep appreciation for nature and a love for international and
        electronic music.

        I chose the path of a Software Engineer because it represents a fundamental pillar in the
        ever-evolving tech world that I hold dear and resonate with. Consequently, I am committed
        to advancing my hard skills, nurturing my soft skills, and undertaking projects to stay
        abreast of the dynamic job market.
